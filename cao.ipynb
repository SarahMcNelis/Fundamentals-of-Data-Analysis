As I struggled to plot the data alongside the other years I found an interesting blog post from someone who had a similar issue over four years ago. The suggestion found in this [blog](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44530047/why-is-my-numeric-data-being-treated-as-an-object) was that when converting from a PDF to a CSV file, the data may have lost it's data type. I decided to test this theory on my dataset by using the [pandas DataFrame dtype](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dtypes.html) function which returns the data type of each columns."

    "The blog where I initally discovered what might be happening suggested using the [pandas to numeric](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_numeric.html) funciton. You pass in the argumnet to be converted which in this case is the column `points_r1_2019`. Then it returns the data as a float or integer depending on the origional argument. Another important note is that I am using the errors paramenter in this function as some rows within this column don't hold any points as that course may not have been offered that year or maybe there was a portfolio or interview required instead. Therefore, by selecting coerce it will set any invalid rows to [NaN](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-methods-to-check-for-nan-values-in-in-python-3f21ddd17eed#:~:text=How%20to%20check%20if%20a%20single%20value%20is%20NaN%20in%20python.&text=NaN%20stands%20for%20Not%20A,major%20problems%20in%20Data%20Analysis.) which means it's not a number.

It then takes us through the steps into loading all three csv files into one dataframe that is then used for analysis. In order to compare data it is important to make sure origional sourcing is preserved alongside any edited work. This allows analysts the option to return to the origonal form in the case or any unforseen errors during the investigation process. The majority of this notebook contains details on how to prepare data for analysis. The analysis itself is a shorter and easy process, that is if the preparation was correct. These skills used in this notebook are an invaluable element in the field of data analytics. "
